  <!-- ================= PROJECT OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Credit risk prediction is a fundamental problem in the financial sector,
      where lenders must assess the likelihood that a borrower will default
      on a loan. Accurate credit risk assessment is essential to minimize
      financial losses while ensuring fair access to credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project develops a machine learning–based credit risk prediction
      system using structured financial data. The goal is to compare traditional
      statistical models with ensemble learning techniques and analyze how
      credit behavior varies across different economic contexts.

  <!-- ================= MODELS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Models Used</h2>
    <p>
      Two machine learning models were implemented to capture different
      characteristics of credit risk.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Logistic Regression:</strong>
        A linear and interpretable baseline model widely used in regulated
        financial environments due to its transparency and stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Random Forest:</strong>
        An ensemble learning model capable of capturing non-linear
        relationships and complex borrower behavior present in real-world
        credit data.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= EVALUATION METRICS ================= -->
  <section class="evaluation-panel">
    <h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>

    <p>
      Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics to capture
      different aspects of credit risk prediction. ROC-AUC measures ranking
      ability, KS statistic evaluates separation power, while recall and
      precision focus on default detection accuracy.

  <!-- ================= RESULT INTERPRETATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Result Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      Experimental results show that Indian credit data exhibits stronger
      linear separability, making Logistic Regression a competitive and stable
      choice. In contrast, US credit data demonstrates higher complexity and
      policy sensitivity, where ensemble models such as Random Forest achieve
      superior performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      These findings indicate that model effectiveness depends not only on
      algorithm selection but also on the underlying economic and financial
      structure of the data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Models are trained on historical data and may require recalibration
        under changing economic conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explainability techniques such as SHAP and LIME can be integrated to
        improve model transparency and trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        An end-to-end loan decision system can be developed by combining
        prediction models with business rules.
      </li>
    </ul>
